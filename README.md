UniqueSQFIDs
============

Hi,

During the testing of my map additions I am working on I got really annoyed by changing the _vehicle_ID to something unique in case it was already taken. I couldn't be bothered doing it after chaning it once so I quickly decided to write a small program to do this for me.

Using the software, all you have to do is set a starting ID and the program will loop through the file you open with it and change all the _vehicle_IDs with your starting ID. It automaticly increases the starting ID by itself.

Hopefully you guys find it useful like I did!
